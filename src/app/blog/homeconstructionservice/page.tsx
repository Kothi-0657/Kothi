        <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Home Construction in India</h2>

        <h3>1. Planning and Conceptualization</h3>
        <p>
          Understand your needs — family size, lifestyle, preferences, and budget. Architects convert ideas into blueprints 
          and 3D visualizations. Key considerations include plot size, building regulations, number of floors, rooms, natural light, 
          ventilation, and future expansion possibilities.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Legal Permissions and Documentation</h3>
        <p>
          Secure approvals from local authorities to avoid penalties. Essential documents include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Building Plan Approval from municipal corporation</li>
          <li>Land Title Deed and ownership proof</li>
          <li>Structural Stability Certificate</li>
          <li>Environmental Clearance (for large plots)</li>
          <li>Water and Electricity Connection Permits</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Foundation and Structural Work</h3>
        <p>
          Foundation bears the entire house load. Common types:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Isolated Footing — for small buildings</li>
          <li>Raft or Mat Foundation — for soft soils</li>
          <li>Pile Foundation — for high-rise or waterlogged areas</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Always do soil testing (geotechnical analysis) before laying the foundation.</p>

        <h3>4. Framing and Structural Shell</h3>
        <p>
          Erect superstructure with RCC, steel, or hybrid materials including columns, beams, slabs, staircases, walls, and roofing. 
          Ensure earthquake-resistant design.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Plumbing, Electrical, and HVAC Systems</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Plumbing: water supply and drainage</li>
          <li>Electrical wiring: lighting, power, security</li>
          <li>HVAC: heating, ventilation, air-conditioning</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6. Roofing and Waterproofing</h3>
        <p>
          Apply waterproofing membranes on roof slabs, bathrooms, balconies, and exterior walls to prevent dampness and structural damage.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Interior and Exterior Finishes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Flooring: vitrified tiles, wooden, marble</li>
          <li>Wall plastering and painting</li>
          <li>Ceiling design: POP, gypsum, wooden beams</li>
          <li>Doors, windows, cabinetry</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>8. Final Inspection and Handover</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Structural integrity</li>
          <li>Electrical and plumbing safety</li>
          <li>Finish quality</li>
          <li>Compliance with approved plans</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A completion certificate ensures adherence to bylaws.</p>
